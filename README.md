Xamarin has just announced preview support for Apple Watch which enables developers using the Unified API to add Apple Watch support to your existing iOS Apps.

I've created a simple Hello World style app which demonstrates all the required parts of getting an app running in the simulator. 

## Prerequisites 

* Xcode 6.2 (beta 4)
* Xamarin.iOS 8.7 (or above)
* Xamarin Studio 5.7.1 (or above)
